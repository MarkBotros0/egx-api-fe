The result is fewer but higher-quality decisions, which is exactly what a beginner needs. Low confidence = a hint to watch; high confidence = a setup worth acting on. Note the zones use tighter RSI cutoffs than the classic 30/70 lines drawn on the RSI chart: an entry is vetoed once RSI reaches 65, and an exit can trigger from 65 upward.

Use WEEKLY to check the bigger trend before you commit — if weekly is falling, be far more demanding of a daily buy signal. MONTHLY is context only: a 200-month average needs 16 years of history, so some score categories have less to work with there. The rule of thumb: the longer timeframe decides WHETHER to buy, the daily decides WHEN. When they disagree, respect the longer one and wait.",
