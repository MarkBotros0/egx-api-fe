/**
 * The risk-grade band ramp — the ONE spelling of it.
 *
 * `RiskGradeCard` (stock detail page) and the small dot on each dashboard
 * `StockCard` both read from here, so the two surfaces cannot drift on colour
 * or wording. The band itself is computed once on the backend by
 * `core/risk_grade.grade_universe`, served by both `/api/risk` and
 * `/api/dashboard`; this is its presentation.
 *
 * COLOUR is a cool→hot intensity ramp, deliberately NOT the app's `gain`/`loss`
 * pair. A risk band has no direction — it says how much a stock MOVES, never
 * which way — so painting "Wild" as a loss would claim a reading the grade does
 * not make. See `RiskGradeCard` and `core/risk_grade` for the full rationale
 * and the never-imply-a-return rule the whole surface lives under.
