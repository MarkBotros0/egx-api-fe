/**
 * One card per stock, from however many lots the user bought it in.
 *
 * Buying the same symbol twice leaves two `portfolio` rows, and the backend
 * analyses each one — but the user owns ONE position in that stock, at an
 * average price. This groups the rows the way the portfolio page shows them.
 *
 * Two rules hold the maths honest:
 *
 *   1. **Average buy price is COST-WEIGHTED**, never the mean of the lot
 *      prices. 200 at 41.00 and 100 at 45.20 is 42.40, not 43.10 — a mean
 *      would let a tiny top-up move the whole position's cost basis.
 *   2. **Annualized return is NOT aggregated.** The lots have different
 *      holding periods, and averaging returns over different windows is the
 *      thing the realized ledger already refuses to do (see
 *      `summarize_realized`). It stays a per-lot figure, shown against each
 *      lot in the expanded card.
 *
 * Every technical field — score, RSI, zones, key levels, P/E — is identical
 * across lots by construction: one symbol, one price fetch, one scoring pass.
 * So the position carries them straight from its first priced lot rather than
 * re-deriving anything.
